# Challengers - Portraits of Paralympic Athletes

## Introduction

Welcome to our final year project, a collaborative effort by two developers and three designers. Our project focuses on the upcoming 2024 Paralympic Games, and we're excited to present an immersive web experience that celebrates the achievements of Paralympic athletes.

Our goal was to create a visually stunning and informative experience that showcases the remarkable journeys of these athletes, highlighting their perseverance and dedication to their sport. We used WebGL technology to bring these stories to life, creating an interactive and engaging experience that we believe will inspire and captivate audiences.

Our team worked closely together to design, develop, and test the application, using an agile development methodology and frequent communication to ensure that we were always on track. We're proud to present a fully-functional web application that we believe provides a unique perspective on the Paralympic Games and the incredible athletes who compete in them.

In this README file, you'll find instructions on how to install and run the application, as well as details on the open source packages and libraries we used to build it. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.


## Prerequisites

To ensure compatibility with the dependencies used in this project, we recommend using the Node.js version specified in the .nvmrc file.

If you have [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed, you can simply run the following command to automatically switch to the recommended version:

```bash
nvm use
```

If you don't have nvm installed, you can download and install it from the official nvm repository.

Alternatively, you can manually install the recommended version of Node.js by checking the .nvmrc file in the root directory of this project and downloading the corresponding version from the official [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) website.

Please note that using a different version of Node.js may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
